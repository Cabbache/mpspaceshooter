## Introduction
This project is a multiplayer game built using Rust for the server and shared logic, and JavaScript for the client-side application. The game logic is shared between the server and client using WebAssembly (Wasm). This ensures deterministic behavior across both environments.

## Project Structure

### Utils
The `utils` directory contains shared Rust code that is compiled to WebAssembly for use in the browser as well as for the server backend.

### Server
The `server` directory contains the Rust code for the game server.

### Client
The `client` directory contains the client-side JavaScript code along with assets and WebAssembly bindings. It also 

## Installation
To get started, you need to have Rust installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cabbache/mpspaceshooter
   cd mpspaceshooter
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   cd utils
   wasm-pack build --target web
   cd ../
   cp -r utils/pkg client/
   ```

## Running the Game

### Server
To run the server and host the client, navigate to the root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo r -r <port number to listen on>
```

This command will automatically host the static website on the specified port and listen for WebSocket messages on the same port.

### Client
To run the client, simply open localhost on the port specified in the browser

## Technical Details

### Shared Code
The shared code in the `utils` directory is crucial for maintaining deterministic game logic across both the server and client. This code includes the definitions for game objects, their behaviors, and the physics calculations.

Key files:
- `lib.rs`: Entry point for the shared code.
- `trajectory.rs`: Contains the physics and movement logic for game objects.
- `shared_gameobjects.rs`: Defines common game objects and their properties.

### Server Implementation
The server is responsible for managing game state, handling player connections, and ensuring synchronized game logic.

Key files:
- `main.rs`: The entry point for the server application.
- `game.rs`: Contains the main game loop and game state management.
- `handler.rs`: Manages incoming and outgoing WebSocket messages.
- `ws.rs`: WebSocket implementation for player communication.

### Client Implementation
The client is a web application that renders the game using [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) and WebAssembly. It communicates with the server to receive game state updates and send player actions.

Key files:
- `main.js`: Entry point for the client-side application.
- `site.html`: Main HTML file that includes the game canvas.

### WebAssembly Integration
The integration of WebAssembly allows the shared Rust code to run both in the browser and on the server. This ensures that the game logic remains consistent and deterministic across different environments.

Key components:
- `wasm-bindgen`: Used to generate bindings between Rust and JavaScript.
- `utils_bg.wasm`: Compiled WebAssembly binary of the shared code.
- `utils.js`: JavaScript bindings generated by wasm-bindgen.
